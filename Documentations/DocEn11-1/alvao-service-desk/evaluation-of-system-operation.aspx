    <h1>Searching, reporting and data analysis</h1>

    <p>The system offers several ways of information retrieval, reporting and data analysis.</p>
    <p>You can search and analyze data in a consistent way in most of the tables that appear in Alvao applications, see <a href="../alvao-asset-management/working-with-tables">Working with tables</a>. If you need to perform more complex analyses or simply create charts and reports, use MS Excel, to which the contents of tables can be easily exported using the <strong>Analyze in Excel</strong> command.</p>
    <p>In particular, the following tables can be used for requests analysis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/requests/table-of-requests">Requests</a></li>
        <li><a href="../list-of-windows/alvao-webapp/diary">Log</a></li>
    </ul>
