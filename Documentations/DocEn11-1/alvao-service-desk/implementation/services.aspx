    <h1>Services</h1>

    <p>Services are delivered to applicants through the Service Desk. Each service has its own solution team, SLA, may have its own email address, etc. One service can also have multiple resolution teams, each for a different group of requesters.</p>
    <p>The ALVAO Service Desk installation also includes a sample service catalogue for common departments in the company.</p>
