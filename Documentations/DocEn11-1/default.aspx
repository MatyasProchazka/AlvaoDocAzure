    <h2>What is Alvao</h2>

    <p>
        Alvao is a system that supports efficient work and order in organisations. Alvao consists of the following components.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="alvao-asset-management">ALVAO Asset Management</a> - IT asset and other asset management</li>
        <li><a href="alvao-service-desk">ALVAO Service Desk</a> - managing requests, tasks, projects</li>
        <li><a href="modules">Extension modules</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information, see <a href="https://www.alvao.com">ALVAO website</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Alvao delivers the most value when the two main products are used together, but the two products can also be used separately. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We are continuously developing the Alvao system and the whole project is very much alive. We find inspiration for the development in new IT technologies, in modern service delivery and management methodologies and especially in the suggestions coming from users who use Alvao in their daily work. We greatly value every feedback from the practice, whether positive or critical, which positively influences further development. We are confident that Alvao will meet your requirements. If not, we would be happy to hear from you, e.g. via <a href="https://www.alvao.com/en/contact#technical-support">Technical Support</a>.

    <h2>Conventions used</h2>

    <p>
        Controlling applications with the mouse is described in the manual from a right-handed perspective, i.e. with normal mouse settings in Windows. Usually the left click is used. The use of the right mouse button is always specified, e.g. <em>&quot;... then right click on...&quot;</em>. Left-handed users usually use settings with the meaning of the left and right mouse button swapped. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Term <strong>click</strong> or <strong>mouse click</strong>
        means to left click briefly and release it again. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The term <strong>mouse click</strong> refers to clicking twice in succession in the same place (double-click).
    </p>
    <p>
        The phrase <strong>drag and drop</strong> refers to the following procedure:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Move the mouse cursor to the object you want to move.</li>
        <li>Press and hold down the left mouse button.</li>
        <li>Move the mouse cursor to the target location.</li>
        <li>Release the mouse button.</li>
    </ol>
