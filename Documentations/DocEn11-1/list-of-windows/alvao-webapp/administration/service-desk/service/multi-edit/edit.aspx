<h1>Edit (bulk)</h1>
<p>This form is used to bulk edit selected <a href="../../../../../../alvao-service-desk/implementation/services">
services</a>.</p>
  <p>The form contains similar items to the form for <a href="../detail/edit">editing a single service</a>. However, only the values of the items you enable on the form (by enabling the option in the title above the corresponding input field) will be changed in bulk in the selected services. Thus, you can change only the icons of the selected services in bulk.</p>
