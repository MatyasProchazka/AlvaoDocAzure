    <h1>ITIL in practice</h1>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The maturity of IT Service Management (ITSM = IT Service Management) is now a critical success factor for most companies. The services provided by the IT department to its customers must be delivered to the agreed quality and situations where this is not happening must be addressed, rectified and prevented quickly enough. This applies to the complete agenda of the IT department, and hence of any service provider. Measurability of work is key, because as we know - what cannot be measured cannot be managed. This will start the imaginary PDCA cycle and enable continuous improvement.

    <p class="MsoNormal">There are many methodologies describing ITSM issues, but the principles remain basically the same. Among the best known are ISO20000, ITIL and COBIT. The aim of this chapter is to present how these principles can be put into practice using the ALVAO Service Desk and ALVAO Asset Management tools.<o:p></o:p></p>
