    <h1>Index of windows and commands</h1>
    <p>The pages in this chapter describe the various forms, windows, and commands from Alvao applications. Directly from the applications, you can usually open them with the help button, i.e., in <a href="list-of-windows/alvao-webapp">ALVAO WebApp</a> with the <strong>?</strong> button on the top right, in desktop applications usually with the <span class="key">F1</span> key, or with the <strong>Help</strong> button.</p>
