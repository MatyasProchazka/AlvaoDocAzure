    <h1>Consumables warehouse</h1>

    <p>
        A warehouse of objects of the same type (&quot;consumables warehouse&quot;) can be created from any object. In order to use an object as a consumables warehouse, it must contain the "Quantity" property.
It is then possible to invoke the <em>Change Quantity...</em> command from the local menu in the object tree to invoke the <a href="../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/change-quantity">Change Quantity</a> window, where you can perform receive/receive operations.
