    <h1>Object samples</h1>
    <p>Object views are specific object prototypes with pre-filled values. You can create object patterns from an existing object, from an object template, or from another object pattern. They are used to create new objects more quickly and are often added to the property tree. For example, if you repeatedly purchase objects (computers, monitors,...) in your company according to a company standard. </p>

    <p>
        To edit the Object Patterns, you need to select <strong>Tools - Settings</strong> from the main menu and on the <strong>Display</strong>, turn on the <strong>Show hidden objects</strong> option.
        This will, among other things, cause the Object Patterns object to appear at the root of the tree.
