<h1>Invoices</h1>

<p>For example, if you want to write an invoice for a computer purchase, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the computer in the object tree.</li>
<li>In the <a href="../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console">
main window</a>, select the <strong>Diary</strong> tab, right-click in the table, and from the context menu select <strong>
Add - Document link</strong>.</li>
<li>A window will open on the screen <a href="../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/tools/lists/documents">
Documents</a> with a list of all documents in the inventory. If an invoice is not already in the inventory, use the <strong>Add</strong> button to add it. Then double-click on the invoice in the list. This will make the invoice appear on the <strong>
Documents</strong> tab in the main window.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the invoice is for the purchase of several computers, enter it in the register according to the above procedure for the first computer only. For the other computers in the window <a href="../../list-of-windows/alvao-asset-management-console/tools/lists/documents">Documents</a> just double-click on an existing invoice and do not create a new one with the <strong>Add</strong> button.</p>
